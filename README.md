## Overview

**Heart Failure Survival** is a clinical visualization dashboard created in **Tableau** to explore patient survival outcomes related to congestive heart failure. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, consisting of 299 patient records with clinical attributes like age, sex, serum sodium, blood pressure, creatinine levels, and comorbidities.All 299 patients had **left ventricular systolic dysfunction** and had previous heart failures that put them in **classes III or IV of the New York Heart Association (NYHA)** classification of the stages of heart failure.


This dashboard visualizes both categorical and continuous risk factors, helping understand their correlation with survival and mortality. It is intended purely as a **technical showcase** and does not make or suggest any medical decisions or interpretations.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Tableau** â€“ For building dashboards and visual analytics  
- **Interactive Filters** â€“ For sex and outcome-based comparisons  
- **Charts Used** â€“ Histograms, bar charts, boxplots, stacked bar charts  

---

## Project Goals

- Analyze survival vs. death rates across different patient profiles  
- Visualize the distribution of clinical parameters such as **ejection fraction, CPK levels, sodium, and creatinine**  
- Compare risk factors like **diabetes, hypertension, anemia, and smoking** with survival outcomes  
- Understand the effect of age and gender on heart failure mortality

## Dashboard Sections

1. **Top-Level Metrics**  
   - Total Admissions  
   - % of Deceased  
   - Median Age (Deceased vs. Survived) by Gender

2. **Comorbidities Overview**  
   - Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Anemia, Smoking

3. **Vital Signs and Labs**  
   - Serum Sodium Classification  
   - CPK Enzyme Level Alerts  
   - Serum Creatinine Analysis  
   - Platelet Count Distributions

4. **Cardiac Function**  
   - Ejection Fraction Categorization (Normal, Mild, HFrEF, Severe Dysfunction)

5. **Demographics**  
   - Age Distribution by Outcome and Gender

## Business Impact

1. **Clinical Dashboards** â€“ Demonstrates the ability to build comprehensive dashboards for patient risk profiling.

2. **Decision Support** â€“ Shows how Tableau can be used in medical environments for identifying mortality-related trends.

3. **Health Insights** â€“ Highlights early warning parameters like abnormal CPK or low ejection fraction that could be integrated into predictive models.

4. **Public Health Demonstration** â€“ Provides a non-invasive example of real-world health monitoring with anonymized data.
